If you locked yourself out:
	1. Go to $JENKINS_HOME in the file system and find config.xml file
	2. Look for the <useSecurity>true</useSecurity> element in this file. Replace true with false
	3. Remote the elements authorizationStrategy and securityRealm
	4. Restart Jenkins

Configure Security -> Enable security
	Access control
		Security realm -> Jenkins own user database (Allow users to sign up - if you want to another users to work too in server)
		Authorization -> logged-in users can do anything (if only for read)

Matrix Authorization:
Install plugin Matrix Authorization Strategy
manage Jenkins -> global security -> Matrix-based security
	add new users 'developers', 'managers', 'testers'
	and for developers and testers all permissions but managers can only read and view for Credentials and Jobs
